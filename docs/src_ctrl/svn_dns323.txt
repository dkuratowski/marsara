Install Subversion to DNS-323:
==============================
1. Install Fonz Fun Plug from http://www.inreto.de/dns323/fun-plug/0.5/
2. Download and install the following packages from http://www.inreto.de/dns323/fun-plug/0.5/packages/
	- apr-1.2.12-2.tgz
	- apr-util-1.2.12-1.tgz
	- neon-0.25.5-1.tgz
	- subversion-1.5.2-1.tgz
	Commands:
		cd /mnt/HD_a2/ffp/pkg/packages/
		funpkg -i apr-1.2.12-2.tgz
		funpkg -i apr-util-1.2.12-1.tgz
		funpkg -i neon-0.25.5-1.tgz
		funpkg -i subversion-1.5.2-1.tgz

3. Edit the svnserve.sh (for example with vi):
	mkdir /mnt/HD_a2/{SVNDIR}
	cd /mnt/HD_a2/ffp/start/
	vi svnserve.sh

4. Create the repository:
	svnadmin create /mnt/HD_a2/svn
	cd /mnt/HD_a2/svn
	cd conf
	joe svnserve.conf

This will open the repository config file, where everything is commented out (with #). You need to uncomment the lines and setup whatever you need. This is what I (user aleck) did:
[general]
anon-access = read
auth-access = write
password-db = passwd
authz-db = authz
realm = <repository-name>

“realm” can be anything you want. Just about anything. Save this file with Ctrl+K, then W. Exit joe with Ctrl+K, then Q. 


5. Edit the password file, using joe or any other editor. In this file add lines in the form user = pass, whatever you want to use to access svn server. Save the file and exit from the editor:

6. Edit the authorisation file:
	joe authz
	Edit the file to be similar to the following:
	[/]
	* = rw

7. Restart the subversion server, in order to load the changes in the configuration files:
 chmod 755 /mnt/HD_a2/ffp/start/svnserve.sh
 /mnt/HD_a2/ffp/start/svnserve.sh restart

8. Now start you SVN client, on your machine and access svn server using:
	svn://nas/
	or whatever is the URL/IP for your DNS-323.
